power = cv^2 freq

at lower operating freq and hence power

concurrency: progressing at same time, e.g webserver

parallelism: executing sametime, e.g:

openMP compiler directive:
#pragma omp construct [clause[clause]]

e.g. #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4)

compilation:

in linux 

gcc -fopenmp foo.c

for bash shell;

export OMP _NUM_THREADS=4

./a.out


H/W:

openMP assumes shared memory computer: any computer composed of multiplr processing elements that share an address space

There are two classes:

1) symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP): a shared address space with equal time  access for each processor, 
OS treats each processor same way
assumes no special blocks in memory, all mmeory is equally accessible

2) Non Uniform Address Space Multiprocessor(NUMA): Differnt memory segments have disffernt cost, eg near memory, far memory
acces time in non uinfotm



Modern processors are not SMP due to cash considerations

A process has its own
Stack(SP,PC, reg), text(text of program), data and heap(mangible memory)

Modern OS decomposes process stack into threads processes

threads: light weight processes, 
that share process state among multiple threads
common text data and heap



Race condition: programs outcome changes with time

To control use synchronization
